## The Graph Integration

The Graph is integrated into the application to provide daily and monthly leaderboards.

The [NEAR Karts Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ben-razor/near-karts) also provides:

* A historical record of the NFT image for each kart as they are upgraded
* Battle details that can be used to replay previous battles
* Records of minting and upgrading events
